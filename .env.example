# WiNet Extractor Environment Example
#
# WINET_HOSTS: Comma-separated list of Sungrow inverter IP addresses.
# WINET_NAMES: Comma-separated list of custom names for each inverter (must match number/order of WINET_HOSTS).
# Example:
#   WINET_HOSTS=192.168.1.100,192.168.1.101
#   WINET_NAMES=garage_roof,workshop_roof
WINET_HOSTS=192.168.1.114,192.168.1.115
WINET_NAMES=garage,roof


# MQTT broker connection
MQTT_URL=mqtt://192.168.1.101:1883

# Optional MQTT authentication (for secure MQTT brokers)
# Leave empty/commented for unencrypted MQTT (default behavior)
# MQTT_USER=your_mqtt_username
# MQTT_PASS=your_mqtt_password


# Optional auth for WiNet (defaults shown)
WINET_USER=admin
WINET_PASS=pw8888


# Polling interval in seconds
POLL_INTERVAL=10


# Prefer HTTPS/WSS to WiNet (self-signed accepted)
SSL=true

# SSL Security Level Configuration
# Controls how SSL certificates are validated when connecting to inverters
#
# DEFAULT BEHAVIOR: If SSL_VALIDATION is commented out or not set, the app defaults to 'bypass' mode
#
# Options:
#   bypass   - Accept any SSL certificate (default when not configured)
#            - Works with self-signed certificates (recommended for most users)
#            - ‚ö†Ô∏è  Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks on untrusted networks
#   
#   pinned   - Validate against specific certificate fingerprints
#            - Enhanced security while maintaining compatibility
#            - Requires setting certificate fingerprints below
#            - üõ°Ô∏è  Recommended for security-conscious users
#
#   strict   - Full SSL certificate validation (maximum security)
#            - Only works if inverters have valid CA-signed certificates
#            - Most inverters will FAIL with this setting
#            - üîí Use only if you know your inverters support proper SSL
#
# Uncomment and set the desired security level (default: bypass when commented)
# SSL_VALIDATION=bypass

# Certificate Fingerprints for Pinned Mode
# Only used when SSL_VALIDATION=pinned
# Get fingerprints by running: ./quick-ssl-check.sh
# Format: SHA256 fingerprint (with or without colons)
#
# Example:
# INVERTER_CERT_FINGERPRINTS=sha256:A1:B2:C3...,sha256:D4:E5:F6...
# INVERTER_CERT_FINGERPRINTS=


# Home Assistant discovery prefix (default: homeassistant/sensor)
HA_PREFIX=homeassistant/sensor


# Disable analytics
ANALYTICS=false


# Single-phase system optimization (default: false for 3-phase)
# Set to true if you have a single-phase inverter to skip unused phase sensors
# This reduces sensors from 29 to 24 by excluding:
# - meter_phaseb_voltage, meter_phasec_voltage
# - meter_phasea_current, meter_phaseb_current, meter_phasec_current
SINGLE_PHASE_SYSTEM=false


# Note: HA_DISCOVERY is not used by this application; discovery is always published
# via MQTT under HA_PREFIX. Keep HA discovery enabled in Home Assistant.
